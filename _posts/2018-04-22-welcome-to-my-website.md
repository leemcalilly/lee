Welcome to my new personal website. It's a scrapbook for everything I'm doing. I chose to build it with a static site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) because it allows me to blog with [markdown](https://www.daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and save any file I want in a format that will be readable even if you're just looking at the source code for the site.

It's hosted on [github pages](https://pages.github.com) and thus under version control and backed up in github. I love the simplicity of this and the fact that the source code is the way I'd like to store this type of data for the longterm (text, photos, music, etc.). It's about the most future-proof way to publish to the web for now. At the end of the day it's all very readable static files organized into simple directories and I can download it all directly from github at any time.
