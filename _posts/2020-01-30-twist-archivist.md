# Where Have You Worked

Currently I am the co-founder and CEO of Original Fuzz, an accessories brand for musicians and artists (https://originalfuzz.com). We have sold over $1MM in products that I've designed, marketed, and manufactured, but I'm at a crossroads as I look at the next decade of my life. Before starting this direct-to-consumer manufacturing business, I was a ruby developer and I seriously miss coding. It's a creative outlet for me and I want to do a new startup that involves software, not manufacturing physical products. I'm currently in the process of exiting Original Fuzz, and this job would be the perfect way for me to transition to my next project. I would put in an honest day's work and then work on new ideas nights & weekends. Jason would have a front-row seat for whatever I do next, and I would get to brainwash myself with the wisdom of every founder that has been a guest on TWIST. I've already listened to the podcast for years, but this role would be a next-level education. In addition, my background is perfect for the job. I was an English major and have worked as a production editor for a publisher (checking grammar, formatting mistakes, etc.). I worked in business development during the Web2.0 era where I pitched top investors like Ron Conway, and attended the first TechCrunch40 where Mint won and the SXSW where Twitter launched. Not only that, as a part of my most recent startup, I've written a web 'zine and hosted a podcast (https://originalfuzz.com/podcast). In that role I've interviewed famous musicians, artists, and chefs, and done all of the production and editing required to publish a podcast. There is probably not a more qualified candidate for this job.


# What Is Your Favorite Startup and Why?

Stripe. No question. I can vividly remember the pain of building Wordpress sites circa 2010 with the PayPal API, or the clunkiness of implementing Rails apps with Braintree. In my opinion, Stripe has done a killer job of solving this problem. The solve such a painful problem in such a delightful way I consider myself a fan of their company. What sort of back-end B2B tool has customers that say that?! They solve their customers'  problems with world-class user-experience design. It's a beautiful solution, a joy to use, and they just keep pushing the envelope with new products like Stripe Atlas (also a joy to use).


# Why Do You Want this Position?

It's the perfect role for me as I need some steady income while working on my next startup. I'll be honestâ€”I will be working on my next project in my free time, but it will not in any way affect my work on TWIST. I can assure you, I'll bring far more to the table than the basic requirements of the job. I'm confident I'll 10x your $50k annual investment in me.

# Favorite Episode of TWIST
Yes. I've been a listener for 4-5 years now. My favorite episodes are with founders that teach me something new. Jason is great at getting his guests to go off into some insightful tangent. First-thought-best-thought: E763 with Front founder Mathilde Collin. The way she thinks about product design and development was inspiring. The methodical way she approaches her customers' needs and how to solve them resonated with my belief in approaching product design from a jobs-to-be-done mental model. Honorable mention for E935 with Segment Co-founder Peter Reinhardt for the same reasons.

# Do You Have Any Work Projects You'd Like to Showcase
Most recently, I founded a company, Original Fuzz (https://originalfuzz.com), that has done over $1MM in sales. I bootstrapped it to profitability. As a part of our content strategy, I've written and edited a 'zine about music and art at https://originalfuzz.com/magazine. I've also produced & hosted a podcast (https://originalfuzz.com/podcast). Favorite interviews include James Beard winning chef Sean Brock and acclaimed producer Roger Moutenot, whose credits include The Big Lebowski soundtrack and artists like Lou Reed. Some of my favorite artists that use Original Fuzz products on tour include Kurt Vile, Built to Spill, Kacey Musgraves, Jason Isbell, Jenny Lewis, Angel Olsen, Real Estate, Fleet Foxes, Parquet Courts, Cage the Elephant, Ty Segall, King Tuff, My Morning Jacket, among many, many others.

# Top Three Books That Inspire You
1. Getting Real by 37 Signals - completely changed my perspective on software
2. The War of Art by Steven Pressfield - taught me what it really takes to be a creative person, a true artist
3. The Sun Also Rises by Hemingway - taught me what good writing looks like. A breath-taking economy of language.
